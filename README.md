# NextJS-starter using docker-compose
Simple setup for dockerizing NextJS App using docker-compose.

Clone and run `docker-compose up -d dev` to start developing inside a container. (Hot reload supported)

`docker-compose up -d prod` for production image/container.

Though, this last still pretty basic, and needs some security patches.
